# AlicesRestaurantOnePageSiteDemo
This is a one-page site using HTML/CSS, created by slicing a PSD as part of my portfolio.
It was my first time ever slicing and dicing in Photoshop. I also used Dreamweaver for the HTML programming portion 
of the project. I did the majority of the CSS in Brackets.
The PSD was sent to me as part of a job interview process, and I was asked to put together as much of it as I could 
within a week.
